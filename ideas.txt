Ideas
1. try train test split and ML without ocr
2. move sequentially through the text and collect the numerical values and units. join them. make a list of all such finds.
3. use ml to predict which value unit pair to be used.
4. use ocr cleaning tools to better extract the text
5. knn to predict empty values
6. check if the correct unit is predicted based on entity name (eg: any unit of weight is used for eneity_name: item_weight). improving this can improve score for sure
7. use llm to predict the entity_value based on entity_name and extracted_text
